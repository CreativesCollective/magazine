                    As an Indonesian photographer based in LA, how has your cultural background influenced your creative vision and approach to photography?

                    Growing up in Indonesia, my cultural background has always been a vital part of my identity, though my connection to it evolved over time. I picked up a camera at 14, during a phase where I wasn’t fully in touch with my roots. I attended an international school, consumed American TV, and grew up with a Westernized perspective, which created a disconnect from my heritage. Moving to LA brought a newfound appreciation for my Indonesian and Chinese-Indonesian heritage.
                    I realized how much my upbringing and cultural mythology shaped my artistic lens. I began to draw inspiration from Indonesia’s rich history, mythology, and vibrant culture, incorporating these elements into my work through unorthodox means—whether it’s my color choices, the way I style my subjects, or how I portray my muses. Living away from home gave me a chance to embrace my roots fully, and my work now reflects a unique blend of being a global artist shaped by my Asian identity. It’s interesting how leaving helped me find pride and love for my heritage and what it means to represent Asian artists in a global context.

                    ArtCoded officially launched in 2024, though the groundwork had been laid over several years. It stemmed from a realization that artistic disciplines—fashion, photography, music, tech, and more—no longer exist in silos. COVID-19 further underscored this interconnectedness, showing how art is consumed, shared, and purchased more dynamically than ever before.
                    ArtCoded’s mission is to merge these worlds and amplify diverse voices. We aim to work across fields—fashion, tech, finance, and music—to create art that is meaningful and impactful. An essential focus is empowering young artists and international creators by providing them with opportunities I once struggled to access. For instance, a recent project in Thailand brought local artists into the spotlight, blending their unique cultural perspective with our production style.
                    ArtCoded is about ensuring every artist has a space to shine and that their voices are heard. I’ve faced challenges in the past figuring out how to break into the industry, and now, with ArtCoded, I want to open doors for others and show them that collaboration can create something extraordinary.

                    ArtCoded strives to amplify voices and create opportunities for artists worldwide. While we specialize in fashion photography, we expand its application to tell diverse stories—working with models, entrepreneurs, and even women leaders who don’t fit the conventional fashion mold. Fashion photography is a language we use to narrate stories that inspire, empower, and create impact.
                    We believe in innovation and breaking barriers. Art should not be limited to aesthetics; it should inspire action, foster inclusivity, and create meaningful conversations. Through ArtCoded, we want to demonstrate that artists from all backgrounds can contribute something unique and valuable to the global arts scene.

                    Our creative process is fluid and varies depending on the project. Sometimes we begin with a concept or narrative, and the casting follows. Other times, we start with the talent and build a story around their unique essence. Whether we’re working on a tech-inspired hyper-surreal project or an empowering women-focused editorial, we ensure the content has depth and purpose.
                    For me, art must go beyond being visually appealing. It should contain a narrative that challenges perceptions, empowers individuals, and sparks cultural conversations. Every project is an opportunity to weave something significant into the global artistic tapestry.
                        
                    With the launch of the “Super Women Entrepreneurs” series, what do you hope to communicate through this project? Why is it important for ArtCoded to spotlight women leaders?
                        
                    The “Super Women Entrepreneurs” series is a vision spearheaded by my incredible co-founder, Tina Kim Park. I grew up admiring powerful, impactful women like my mother, who is a celebrated fashion designer, and icons like Lady Gaga. These women embody strength, elegance, and resilience, balancing traditional roles with groundbreaking achievements.
                    Through this series, we aim to celebrate the multifaceted nature of womanhood—whether as mothers, leaders, or dreamers. By spotlighting these voices, we hope to inspire others, showing that empowerment comes in many forms. Women can lead with strength, nurture with compassion, and shatter glass ceilings, all while staying true to themselves.

                    Collaboration is rooted in the belief that there is room for everyone to shine. Growing up, I experienced a culture of competition, which I now recognize as toxic. As artists, we face enough challenges, so fostering a supportive community is vital.
                    I make a conscious effort to nurture relationships based on respect and mutual growth. Gatekeeping has no place in art. Sharing resources and celebrating others’ successes strengthens the community and creates opportunities for all. Helping another artist succeed is one of the most rewarding aspects of my work, as it feeds into a cycle of generosity and growth.

                    My work often celebrates powerful women and leans into themes of surrealism and world-building—whether futuristic or nostalgic.

                    Each piece I create is an extension of myself. Whether I’m experimenting with bold aesthetics or subtle nuances, my goal is to craft something that reflects who I am while resonating with others.

                    I’ve embraced AI as a tool, not a substitute for artistry. My introduction to AI came during an NFT project, where it was a means to achieve a specific vision under tight constraints. To me, AI is like any other tool—whether it’s a camera or editing software. It complements my work, adding futuristic, uncanny elements to projects. While AI remains controversial, I believe its responsible use can push artistic boundaries and enhance creative expression.
