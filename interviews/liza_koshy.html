                <span class="para-text">My cultural heritage is this intricate, layered tapestry made up of my Indian roots, Southern upbringing, and the multicultural environment of Houston, Texas. My dad is from Kerala, India, and my mom is from Harrisonburg, Virginia. She has Mennonite roots, which are tied to Amish traditions. That blend of Eastern and Western influences was a constant in my life growing up, and it deeply shaped my perspective on the world. My parents instilled in me the values of peace, pacifism, and service. My dad was part of the Brethren church in Kerala, and my mom’s side had Mennonite ties—both traditions emphasize nonviolence, community, and simplicity. That’s made me a peaceful person at my core, someone who values connection and harmony over conflict. Growing up in Houston, I was surrounded by diversity, and it left such an impression on me. Houston is the most multicultural city in the country—even more so than New York—and being immersed in so many different communities shaped who I am. I went to dual language immersion classes from the age of five to eleven, where I learned everything in Spanish and English. Science, math, history—it was all taught in 90% Spanish and 10% English. That made my brain “sticky,” as I like to say, and opened me up to understanding other cultures in a deep way. I wasn’t just learning Spanish in class; I was going to Quinceañeras, dancing in the Sabor Latino group at my middle school, and attending cultural school events that celebrated diversity. I always say I grew up between two cultures: Indian and American. But really, I grew up between many cultures. My parents brought Indian traditions into our home, but they also emphasized Southern hospitality—ensuring that every guest felt at home, every stomach was full, and every moment together was meaningful. Those values have translated directly into my career. Whether I’m hosting New Year’s Rockin’ Eve or interviewing Snoop Dogg on Amazon Music Live, I try to create a space where people feel welcome and at ease, like they’re at a home away from home. My cultural heritage also influences how I see and create characters. I’m never just the “Indian best friend” or the “ethnically ambiguous sidekick.” I bring the multitudes of my identity—being Indian, being Southern, being a product of this incredibly multicultural upbringing—into the roles I play. My dad and mom taught me to embrace every part of who I am, and that’s what I bring to my creative work.

                My dad sparked my passion for acting and creativity. He’s an actor at heart—he had dreams of acting but put them aside to provide for our family as an immigrant in America. I think I picked up on his love for storytelling from a young age. There’s this moment that stands out to me: I was about six years old, and I said something witty during a family conversation. My dad turned to my uncle and said, “She’s quick, huh?” That comment stayed with me. It was like he saw something in me—a spark, a strength—and I held onto that. I wanted to be “quick,” to nurture whatever it was that made him proud.
                Being the youngest of three daughters, I had a lot of freedom to explore. My older sisters were academically focused—the “perfect children” who set the standard—and by the time my parents got to me, they let me experiment a bit more. I was the chaotic, creative one. Dinner table conversations became my stage. I loved making my family laugh, diffusing tension with humor, and finding ways to connect through quick wit and charm.
                My dad’s belief in me has been a constant source of strength. He’s always sending me ideas for characters, scripts, or projects. He’s been in one of my productions, Lies on Demand, and so has my mom. They’re both theater kids who met at Eastern Mennonite University in Virginia, and their love for the arts runs deep. My mom brings grace and compassion to everything she does, and my dad is my loudest cheerleader. Together, they gave me the foundation to pursue this unpredictable, challenging career.
                As I’ve grown, my passion has evolved. When I was younger, I wanted to be the pitcher pouring out everything for everyone, giving joy and light to others without taking care of myself. Now, I know to fill my own cup first. I’m still that person who loves to make others laugh and feel connected, but I’ve learned to balance that with self-care and intentionality in my craft.

                Are there any misconceptions about Asian creatives you hope to challenge through your work?

                <span class="para-text">
                One of the biggest misconceptions about Asian creatives is that we exist as a monolith. There’s this tendency in Hollywood to reduce us to a single narrative, whether it’s the “model minority” stereotype or the token “Asian best friend.” But the truth is, our stories are as diverse as we are.
                While we’re seeing more Asian representation on screen, the progress behind the camera—among producers, directors, writers, and crew—is still lacking. That lack of diversity influences the kinds of stories that get told and how authentically they’re portrayed. When I’m on set, I notice the difference when there are Asian creatives in key roles, like hair and makeup or costume design. They bring a level of understanding and cultural nuance that makes the entire production feel more authentic.
                Through my work, I want to challenge the illusion of progress in Hollywood. Representation isn’t just about seeing Asian faces on screen; it’s about creating an ecosystem where Asian creatives are part of the storytelling process from start to finish. I hope to one day direct productions that reflect this vision—sets that are as diverse and inclusive as the stories they’re telling.
                We need to move beyond surface-level representation and create lasting change. That means hiring Asian talent at every level of production, from the writers’ room to the editing bay. It’s not just about being visible; it’s about being heard and valued for our unique perspectives.

                Through my work, I want to explore the complexity of identity, womanhood, and the human experience. As a woman, a Christian, and someone who’s been labeled a “model minority,” I’ve navigated the pressure to meet expectations that don’t always align with who I am. I want to tell stories that capture the pendulum of emotions women experience—the strength and vulnerability, the joy and self-doubt, the service and self-discovery.
                Asian culture is shaping the entertainment industry by expanding the kinds of stories we tell and the ways we tell them. Productions like Never Have I Ever are a great example. They beautifully capture the Indian-American experience while also making those stories universal. But I want to see more. I want there to be so many Asian-led productions that I don’t have to struggle to name them. I want our stories to be as varied and complex as we are—not just “Asian stories,” but human stories that happen to be Asian.
                Every story we tell pushes the industry closer to a more inclusive future. I’m excited to be part of that change, but I also know there’s still so much work to be done.

                What advice would you give to young Asian creatives starting out, and how can they stay true to their identity while navigating a global market?

                    My biggest advice is to know what’s in your toolbox and own it. The industry is like a potluck—you have to bring your flavor. Whether it’s comedy, drama, or something else, figure out what you’re good at, refine it, and offer it confidently.
                    Staying true to your identity starts with understanding who you are. If you don’t know what makes you unique, you’ll end up trying to fit into someone else’s mold. Push against that. Offer what fulfills you, even if the industry isn’t sure how to appreciate it yet. The right roles and opportunities will come when you stay authentic.
                    Rejection is part of the process, and it’s rarely personal. Timing, casting needs, or even something as small as your hair color can influence decisions. Trust in your craft, keep showing up, and remember that your worth isn’t tied to any single role or project.
                    Know your spices, bring them to the table, and trust that someone out there will appreciate the flavor you offer.
